# Image Captioning using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project implements an image captioning model using deep learning techniques. The model generates textual descriptions for images by leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and a sequence-based model for caption generation.

## Dataset
The project uses the **Flickr8k Dataset**, which consists of:
- 8,000 images
- 5 captions per image

## Model Architecture

The captioning model consists of:
1. **Feature Extraction**: Pretrained CNN models (**ResNet50**, **ResNet101**) extract high-level image features.
2. **Caption Generation**: A neural network processes the extracted features and generates captions.
3. **Evaluation**: Captions are evaluated using **BLEU Score**, a metric for natural language generation.

## Implementation Details
### **Libraries Used**
- `PyTorch` for deep learning
- `torchvision` for image transformations
- `PIL` for image handling
- `nltk` for natural language processing
- `matplotlib` for visualization

### **Training Pipeline**
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Images are resized and normalized.
2. **Model Training**:
   - A dataset class (`Flickr8kDataset`) loads images and captions.
   - The dataset is split into training and validation sets.
   - Captions are tokenized and processed.
3. **Caption Generation**:
   - The trained model generates a textual description for an image.
   - Predictions are compared with ground truth captions.
4. **Evaluation**: Captions are evaluated using the **BLEU Score**.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## Results
The model generates captions for images by recognizing objects and their relationships. Evaluation metrics and example outputs are included in the notebook.

## Future Improvements
- Implementing attention mechanisms to improve caption relevance.
- Using Transformer-based models for better language generation.
